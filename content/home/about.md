### How can we predict the evolution of Earth's oceans and climate on time scales longer than humans have ever observed?

Studying how geophysical, chemical, and biological processes conspired to trace out Earthâ€™s climate past helps us understand modern ocean and climate dynamics, human evolution, and conditions on other worlds.

My research combines **numerical models** and **observations** of the natural world to learn about the dynamics Earth's oceans and climate in the **present, future, and geologic past.**
